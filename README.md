# Search Assessment

This is a test assessment for a search for restaurants.

## Assumptions

As requested, no third party search or sorting tools were used in this assessment. There is a very basic database running in this project (sqlite3) just to build a relation for the entities. All of the search and sorting are done only by Ruby code.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install ruby
$ sudo apt install ruby

# install rails
$ gem install rails

# install gems related to the project
$ bundle install

# run the project on localhost:3000
$ rails s
```

## Testing
The framework for testing used was Rspec. To run the tests available use the following command:

```bash
rspec
```
